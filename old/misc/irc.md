# IRC

**I have an IRC channel!**

You can find the channel at #SMT on espernet. If you're not sure how to access IRC, I've provided a neat webapp at the bottom of this page you can use.

## Rules
Yes, I have rules. Don't worry, there's not too many.

* Don't ask to ask. Ask your question and someone will probably answer you soon. If you don't get an answer, be patient.
* Don't spam.
* Don't be a jerk.
* You may ping me (tterrag) by saying my name, but this does not guarantee you an immediate response. Refer to rule #1.

## WebChat

Remember, this is a ***LIVE*** chat with other real people. It is not anyone's job to answer your question, so be patient, always.
