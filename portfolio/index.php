						Chisel adds a massive amount of new decorative blocks to the game, most of which are variants on existing blocks. It utilizes a unique crafting method, the chisel, to choose between the myriad options available to the player. Many of the blocks use advanced rendering, colloquially known as "CTM", or connected textures.
					</p><p>
						I began working on the Chisel project in early 2015, mainly to do bug fixing and quality-of-life changes. Eventually, I became the main developer on the project, and along with Drullkus and minecreatr have maintained the mod since then, including a full rewrite for Minecraft 1.8+. Since then, the sister mod CTM was born when I realized the rendering part would be useful to other modders, and artists in general.
					</p><p>
						Since August 2015, Chisel has been downloaded over 40 million times from CurseForge.

						Connected Textures Mod is a utility for artists. It extends the Minecraft model and texture metadata formats with additional capabilities, such as connected textures, patterns, edge blending, and emissivity. It requires no code to be used, only edits to the JSON files that make up a resource pack.
					</p>
					<p>
						CTM is used by mods to enhance their blocks, such as <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-twilight-forest">Twilight Forest</a>, <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering">Immersive Engineering</a>, and <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mekanism">Mekanism</a>, as well as many more. Since May 2017, it has been downloaded over 22 million times from CurseForge.

						EnderIO is a massive tech mod, with a magical theme focused on souls and industry. The most distinctive feature is its conduits, which allow transporting items, fluid, power, redstone, and more within a single block. Since 2013 when CrazyPants started the mod, it has grown into one of the largest tech mods, with content for almost every aspect of the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						I joined the mod in 2014, mostly as a wiki editor, and doing small pull requests. Soon I was brought on as an official developer, and later when CrazyPants had less time to devote to the mod, the main developer. Eventually, I also had less time to devote to EnderIO, so the torch was passed on. But I remain an active part of the team, mainly running the discord server, website, and continuous integration services.

						Since August 2013, EnderIO has been downloaded over 30 million times from CurseForge.

						Practical Space Fireworks brings the concept of satellites into Minecraft. It allows the player to build completely free-form rockets, fill them with fuel, and build satellites that will then be launched in to orbit to perform various functions, such as reconnaissance, mapping, and giant space lasers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Practical Space Fireworks began as a mod created for ModJam 5, a mod creation competition that takes place over a weekend, in 2018. Since then it has had multiple updates to bring the mod into a more stable and complete state.

						TGS was made in 2014 specifically for the <em>SkyFactory</em> modpack. It does one simple thing: trees grow when you dance near them. While simple, this revolutionizes the beginning of the popular "skyblock" game type. Less waiting, more dancing!

						Simple Achievements was also made specifically for the <em>SkyFactory</em> modpack. It provides a simple book of achievements for the player to complete, which are not tied to any specific criteria; essentially, a checklist. While simple on the surface, it is fully configurable for modpack developers to add whatever achievements they desire.

						The most popular modding API for Minecraft. I joined the MinecraftForge project in 2018 to assist with managing issues and pull requests, and was soon brought on as a developer to assist with the update to Minecraft 1.13. Before 2018 I had made many pull requests to add various features. In total I have made nearly 50 pull requests to Forge, and many more direct contributions since being brought on as a developer.

						One of the oldest mods still receiving updates, Tropicraft adds a whole new dimension to the game. An idyllic, charming paradise in which to dream, explore, and let your creativity run free: The Tropics. Lush forests, winding rivers, and oceans teeming with life make the tropics a place for endless exploration and discovery.
					</p>
					<p>
						I joined the Tropicraft project in 2017, shortly after my trip to Minecon 2016 where I met the creators Cojomax99 and Corosus. Since then I have assisted with the arduous update to Minecraft 1.10 from 1.7, and further maintenance and features. Before joining the project I did not know much about it, but I have come to realize why so many adore the mod, and why it continues to find its place in the community today.

						Not a mod, but a yearly weekend-long charity stream to raise money for hurricane repairs in the tropics, specifically Puerto Rico. The event takes place in Minecraft, as a hosted server that anyone can join for a minimum donation. The stream is 48 hours long, and offers wall-to-wall activities and giveaways.
