						Chisel adds a massive amount of new decorative blocks to the game, most of which are variants on existing blocks. It utilizes a unique crafting method, the chisel, to choose between the myriad options available to the player. Many of the blocks use advanced rendering, colloquially known as "CTM", or connected textures.
					</p><p>
						I began working on the Chisel project in early 2015, mainly to do bug fixing and quality-of-life changes. Eventually, I became the main developer on the project, and along with Drullkus and minecreatr have maintained the mod since then, including a full rewrite for Minecraft 1.8+. Since then, the sister mod CTM was born when I realized the rendering part would be useful to other modders, and artists in general.
					</p><p>
						Since August 2015, Chisel has been downloaded over 40 million times from CurseForge.

						Connected Textures Mod is a utility for artists. It extends the Minecraft model and texture metadata formats with additional capabilities, such as connected textures, patterns, edge blending, and emissivity. It requires no code to be used, only edits to the JSON files that make up a resource pack.
					</p>
					<p>
						CTM is used by mods to enhance their blocks, such as <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-twilight-forest">Twilight Forest</a>, <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering">Immersive Engineering</a>, and <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mekanism">Mekanism</a>, as well as many more. Since May 2017, it has been downloaded over 22 million times from CurseForge.
