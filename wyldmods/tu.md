# Tool Utilities

Tool Utilities adds "Tinkers"-like functionality to tools, while maintaing a vanilla feel.

All upgrades are applied using an Anvil, with a user-configurable item and amount of experience.

## Features
### Area of Effect Mining
Pickaxes, shovels and axes (and even paxels) can be upgraded to mine in a 1x3, and then a 3x3 area. Note that the 3x3 upgrade requires the 1x3 upgrade to be applied.

Note that the area of effect mining will check for block hardness, and so one can not mine obsidian simply by placing some stone next to it. The upgrade also checks for mining level - so don't go expecting your stone pickaxe to mine some diamonds.

### Area of Effect Attacks
Most swords can be upgraded to attack areas in a reasonable area. The sword will take one point of durability damage per enemy hit.

### Scythe
Hoes can be upgraded to act as a scythe in a small area. The hoe will take one point of durability damage for each grass-like block broken.

### Right-Click Placing
Almost every tool can be upgraded to have the ability to place blocks/use items in the adjacent slot. The tool in the first slot will use items from the last slot. All other tools use the slot to the right of them. Great for placing torches, or cobblestone, or a water bucket!
